# Argus

**Argus** is a GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot)
to watch for repository's workflows with tests, download artifacts with screenshots differences images,
and pin these images to bot's comment of pull request.

> **Why "Argus"?** Argus is a many-eyed "all-seeing" giant in Greek mythology.
> This character is known for having generated the saying "the eyes of Argus"
> (being subject to strict scrutiny in one's actions to an invasive, distressing degree).
> [(c) Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_Panoptes)

## Setup :rocket:

You can deploy your own bot using this code
or use already hosted **[lumberjack-bot](https://github.com/apps/lumberjack-bot)**.

> We actively use **lumberjack-bot** in our UI Kit library [Taiga UI](https://github.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/taiga-ui).
> It watches our taiga-components, and it can keep track of your repository too.
> Do not hesitate to integrate it in your project's development.

To begin using bot:

-   [Invite](https://github.com/apps/lumberjack-bot/installations/new) him to you repo.
-   See its [configurable params](#bot-configurations-gear) or use default ones.

## Bot configurations :gear:

Bot has configurable params which can be unique for every Github repository.<br>
Every param is optional, and you can skip this section if default configuration satisfies you.

To pass custom params for bot you should create `screenshot-bot.config.yml` file inside the `.github` directory of repository.

**Example of `screenshot-bot.config.yml` file content** (you can paste it as it is) and **default values** of each param:

```yaml
# array of regular expression strings to match workflow names
# which should be watched by bot
workflowWithTests: [
        # all workflows with sub-string "screenshot" in their names
        '.*screenshot.*',
    ]

# array of RegExp strings to match images inside artifacts (by their path or file name)
# which shows difference between two screenshot and which will be added to bot report comment
screenshotsDiffsPaths: [
        # it is default cypress folder name into which snapshot diffs are put
        '.*__diff_output__.*',
    ]

# Regular expression string to match images inside artifacts (by their path or file name)
# which are created by new screenshot tests.
newScreenshotMark: '.*==new==.*'

# array of RegExp strings to match branch names which should be skipped by bot
branchesIgnore: []

# array of attributes (key="value") for html-tag <img /> (screenshots)
screenshotImageAttrs: ['height="300px"']

# Text which is placed at the beginning of section "Failed tests"
failedTestsReportDescription: ''
```

## What bot can do? :bulb:

-   Holds first PR comment.
    All workflow updates edit already existing bot comment.
    No endless stream of comments from bot!
-   Sets loading state comment when PR is opened or new commits are pushed to PR.

-   Downloads artifacts from workflow with tests, finds screenshots diffs images, and pins them to the tests failure report.
    ![error-report-demo](.demo/error-report.png)
-   Removes all uploaded images (for current PR) after closing pull request.

## About Permissions :closed_lock_with_key:

At the beginning of the bot's installation it asks for some permissions.<br>
All of them are really needed, and we do not ask for more permissions than necessary.

#### Permissions

Bot requires the following repository's **permissions**:

-   `actions: read` - to get list of workflow run artifacts and download these artifacts.
-   `contents: write` - to create new branch for storage of screenshot diffs images
    and to ability to upload/delete these screenshot diffs images.
-   `metadata: read` - mandatory for Github App.
-   `pull_requests: write` - to create/edit PR's comment with bot's tests reports.

#### Events

Bot listens to the following repository's **events**:

-   `pull_request` â€” bot listens to pull request closing to delete all saved screenshots for current closed PR.
-   `workflow_run` â€” bot listens to workflow completion to download artifacts and send tests report as PR comment.
